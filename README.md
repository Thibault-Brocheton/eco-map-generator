# Eco Map Generator

## Work In Progress !

For now, this project only allows to generate image files, that will be loaded by a development version of Eco Server.  
One day, if this development version is integrated in Eco Server, anyone will be able to load these image files and generate the map.

## Launch the project

Requirements: Nodejs: https://nodejs.org
Install dependencies: `npm install`
Run server: `node index.js`

Access the generator: http://localhost:3000
